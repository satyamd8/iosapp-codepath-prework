  An app idea I'd like to build is a study tool app that helps and tracks your study sessions. It would be a port of my existing website project, "da.ily".
  It involves festures such as an interactice UI and themes, study session analysis in the forms of graphs and charts, a calendar to plan your study sessions and
  get reminders, and various timers like the Pomodoro timer. A feature not currently implemented in my web project is a Groups feature, where one can invite
  other users to a shared space dedicated to a specific task or club, where you can share messages and files to one another.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
